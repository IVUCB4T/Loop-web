# Loop-web


This HTML document sets up a simple web page with a title of "Loop-web" and includes a link to an external stylesheet named "styles.css". The JavaScript code in the <script> tag at the end of the body will redirect the user to a specified website after a delay.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The HTML structure includes the necessary elements for a basic webpage: a doctype declaration, opening and closing <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.

2. In the <head> section:
   - The character set is set to UTF-8.
   - The viewport meta tag is included for responsive design.
   - The title of the page is set to "Loop-web".
   - A link to an external stylesheet named "styles.css" is included for styling the page.

3. In the <body> section:
   - A <script> tag is used to include an external JavaScript file named "script.js". This script contains the code that will redirect the user to a specified website after a delay.

4. The JavaScript code in "script.js":
   - Uses setTimeout to execute a function after a specified delay (in this case, 3000 milliseconds or 3 seconds).
   - Inside the function, window.location.href is set to 'https://ivucb4t.github.io/Loop-web/', which will redirect the user's browser to the specified URL after the delay.

When a user visits this webpage, they will see the content of the page briefly before being automatically redirected to the specified website (https://ivucb4t.github.io/Loop-web/) after a 3-second delay.
